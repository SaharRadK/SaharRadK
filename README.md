# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sahar

I'm a data analyst with 10+ years of experience in the telecom industry, now based in Germany and open to full-time roles in data analysis, BI, or reporting.

I love making messy data useful â€” whether thatâ€™s through SQL reporting, Power BI dashboards, or Python automation. I bring both technical skills and business insight, backed by a strong academic background in math and an MBA.
